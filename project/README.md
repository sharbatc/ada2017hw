# I'm Only Human

# Abstract
>[I'm only human after all; Don't put your blame on me...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_(Rag%27n%27Bone_Man_song))

This project aims to combat the rise of populism, especially right wing populism in the world in general and Europe and the USA in particular over the last few years. Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, the increase in vote shares of the popular right in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, France, India, Iceland, etc might lead to questions about who they appeal to and how. We will try to see whether those who are blamed by the populist narrative are rightly so (effectively looking at the media perception versus actual happenings), and see if and how a 'global' trend of nationalism can be traced. The [GDELT dataset](https://www.gdeltproject.org/data.html#rawdatafiles) already has been used a number of times before for example, to see if the [Arab Spring](https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/05/30/did-the-arab-spring-really-spark-a-wave-of-global-protests/) has sparked protests worldwide and to show the media perception about the political situation in [Nigeria](https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/03/13/mapping-violence-and-protests-in-nigeria/).  What we want to do is to provide insight into how narratives of populism have grown by tracing them across time and space and then by using the [UCDP dataset](http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/)(hopefully) see how the media portrayal might be different from the actual portrayal. A lot of media in the recent times has been subject to a bubble effect and this might show in our analysis. We want to tell this story so that people know what they are reading versus what others are reading, and see whether the apparently justified claims of people eager and quick to blame the Other in a populist narrative are true. 

>Maybe I'm foolish; Maybe I'm blind; Thinking I can see through this; And see what's behind; Got no way to prove it; So maybe I'm blind...

# Research questions
* Can we show the existence of bubbles in media portrayal of events and show a critical mass of the same?
* Can we show whether the rise in populism at one place led to it in other places? (an ironic global rise in nationalist fervour)
* Can we present the data in a way that might prevent the rise of populism?

# Dataset
We have an overview of the dataset from the documentation mentioned [here](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GDELT-Data_Format_Codebook.pdf). An example usage of the same is mentioned in [here](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/ISA.2013.GDELT.pdf). The [UCDP dataset](http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/) based on per country basis is what we are planning to think of as a ground truth for conflicts. They can then be correlated to what is being shown in the different branches of the news to see what each news source chooses to show and who or what they choose to blame in the process (from the 'tone' of the news article. The tone is a variable in the GDELT dataset).

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
* Clean the dataset to see what particular event might we focus on at first. 
* Display and find out an event which might be interpreted differently depending on the source of the news. 
* Possibly see where one version of the news is concentrated more and try to comment and correlate that to the political fate of that place. 
* Find out one prototype news event and places that work.


# Questions for TAs
* The data set seems big and extensive. Can we reduce it to a time period or space where it might showcase our aims? 
* Is there any way to think what the 'tone' might be used as apart from showing how and in what direction some news article is biased?

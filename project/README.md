This project aims to think about the rise of populism, especially right wing populism in the world in general and Europe and the USA in particular over the last few years. Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, the increase in vote shares of the popular right in Germany, Austria, France, Switzerland, India, etc. and the recent win of the populists in Iceland might lead to questions about who they appeal to and how. We will try to see whether those who are blamed for it are rightly so (effectively looking at the media perception versus actual happening), and see if and how a 'global' trend of nationalism can be traced. The GDELT data already has been used a number of times before for example, to see if the [Arab Spring](https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/05/30/did-the-arab-spring-really-spark-a-wave-of-global-protests/) has sparked protests worldwide and to show the media perception about the political situation in [Nigeria](https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/03/13/mapping-violence-and-protests-in-nigeria/).  What we want to do is to try and understand this rise of populism to see if there was one event which has triggered this across the last few years.

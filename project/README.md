# Abstract

As average human life span has been increasing in the last few years, the threat of neurodegenerative diseases loom large. It has now become a major health problem in the world with annual costs in the USA associated with neurological diseases are around 800 billion dollars, 100 billion more than the US military budget, as mentioned [here](#References)
The causes for neurodegenerative diseases are mostly unknown but their prevalence is on a steep rise all over the world and people are getting affected earlier than ever. One major disease that is prevalent throughout the world is Parkinson's disease. Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s. It’s most obvious symptoms include shaking, rigidity and difficulty with walking. There is currently no cure for Parkinson’s but there are ways of keeping it’s symptoms down and delaying it’s progression, for example with deep brain stimulation. These methods are most effective when patients begin treatment as early as possible and therefore powerful diagnostic methods are essential. This project aims to help in diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases in general and Parkinson's Disease in particular.

# Research questions


# Dataset


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
* Clean the dataset to see what particular event might we focus on at first. 
* Display and find out an event which might be interpreted differently depending on the source of the news. 
* Possibly see where one version of the news is concentrated more and try to comment and correlate that to the political fate of that place. 
* Find out one prototype news event and places that work.


# Questions for TAs
* The data set seems big and extensive. Can we reduce it to a time period or space where it might showcase our aims? 
* Is there any way to think what the 'tone' might be used as apart from showing how and in what direction some news article is biased?

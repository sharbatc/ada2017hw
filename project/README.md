# I'm Only Human

# Abstract
>[I'm only human after all; Don't put your blame on me...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_(Rag%27n%27Bone_Man_song))

This project aims to think about the rise of populism, especially right wing populism in the world in general and Europe and the USA in particular over the last few years. Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, the increase in vote shares of the popular right in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, France, India, etc. as well as the recent win of the populists in Iceland might lead to questions about who they appeal to and how. We will try to see whether those who are blamed by the populist narrative are rightly so (effectively looking at the media perception versus actual happenings), and see if and how a 'global' trend of nationalism can be traced. The [GDELT dataset](https://www.gdeltproject.org/data.html#rawdatafiles) already has been used a number of times before for example, to see if the [Arab Spring](https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/05/30/did-the-arab-spring-really-spark-a-wave-of-global-protests/) has sparked protests worldwide and to show the media perception about the political situation in [Nigeria](https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/03/13/mapping-violence-and-protests-in-nigeria/).  What we want to do is to provide insight into how narratives of populism have grown by tracing them across time and space and then by using the [UCDP dataset](http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/)(hopefully) see how the media portrayal might be different from the actual portrayal. A lot of media in the recent times has been subject to a bubble effect and this might show in our analysis. We want to tell this story so that people know what they are reading versus what others are reading, and see whether the apparently justified claims of people eager and quick to blame the Other in a populist narrative are true.

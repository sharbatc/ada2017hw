#Introduction

Parkinson's disease is caused by a progressive degeneration of certain neural cells of the central nervous systems. Those neurons
are responsible for dopamine production, a chemical used into the brain to exchange signals between cells. The loss of dopaminergic
function produces drastic changes in circuits of a brain region called basal ganglia, known to be involved in the execution of
voluntary movements
As a consequence, patients slowly start to present motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity or in
general difficulties in movements. In advanced stages, dementia as well as other behavioral problems gradually take the upper hand.
Before those symptoms become clinically relevant, 80% of the dopamine in a region of the brain called striatum
may be already lost.
Early diagnosis
Different regions of the brains typically activate together in what neuroscientists calle "brain networks".
Those networks are used to study brain architecture and function
Many brain diseases, including Parkinson, cause a general disorganization in the connections
When people are at rest
Studying how Parkinson's disease affects neural networks could help understanding the mechanisms underlying the
pathophysiology of the disorder, diagnosing and in particular evaluating treatments.
Study the consequences of dopamine loss on the functions of the brain.

# Dataset
One of the missions of the Parkinson's progression markers initiative is to collect advanced imaging data in order to identify
 biomarkers for the evaluation of the disease.

This project wouldn't have been possible without of course, the work done by the
three members of the team and also with help from Tiziano and Giovanni, our wonderful
TAs. We would also like to acknowledge the PPMI dataset for making the dataset
available publicly.

Thanks a lot to Bob for giving us the freedom and help us learn the skills to do this project!

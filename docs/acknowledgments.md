This project wouldn't have been possible without of course, the work done by the
three members of the team and also with help from Tizziano and Giovanni, our wonderful
TAs. We would also like to acknowledge the PPMI dataset for making the dataset
available publicly. Thanks a lot to Bob for giving us the freedom to do choose our work
